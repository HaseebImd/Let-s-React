### Project Overview

This project is a basic React application showcasing the following concepts:

1. **Props and State**:
   - Passing data between components using props.
   - Managing component state using `useState` for counter, name input, and other dynamic data.

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Handled button click events to increment a counter.
   - Handled input change events to update the state and display dynamic user input.

3. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - Dynamically rendered a list of items (`items`) using the `.map()` function.
   - Displayed user data (name, age) from an array of objects (`users`) with unique keys.

4. **Dynamic List Rendering**:
   - Included a separate component (`DynamicTasks`) to render a dynamic list of tasks, demonstrating modular component usage.

5. **Reusable Component**:
   - Created and used a `Greeting` component that receives a complex object (`data`) as props to display structured information.

### Key Features:

- **Counter Functionality**: A button to increment a counter displayed on the page.
- **Name Input**: An input field that updates the displayed name based on user input.
- **List Rendering**: Rendered a list of items and user information from arrays using React's `map()` function.
- **Dynamic Components**: Separated logic into components to enhance code reusability and structure.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding React's core features, such as state management, event handling, and rendering lists.
